# Ricco's dotfiles

These are my configuration files for various system settings. Feel free to use
them if you can.

## ‚öí  Installation

Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:fiskeben/dotfiles.git`.
Currently these files expect to exist in `~/dotfiles`.

Run `install.sh` which will create a symlink to `.bash_profile` and `.inputrc`
in your home directory.

## üëç  Credits

The layout, scripting, aliases, functions, and more is based on [Lars Kappert's
article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789#.uoen8rp4a) 
and the examples linked to in that article.

For more information on what dotfiles is etc, see [GitHub's
guide to dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io).
